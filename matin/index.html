				<p>The Salty Pistachio Podcast was created in 2020 by me and my friends. The goal of this podcast is to interview people who have gone into a certain program or path and ended up completely switching what they wanted to do. This is to reassure high school students that they don't need to have everything figured out by the time they graduate.</p>
